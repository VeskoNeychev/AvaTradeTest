// We can use different types of job workers like CRON with Quartz.NET, Windows Service, Hangfire, or anything else that will meet company requirements.
// My preference is Windows Service. I have a lot of experience with it, and the best thing is that it's very reliable.
// Unfortunately, it only runs on Windows, and implementing can add a bit of complexity.
// A second solution might be Hangfire, which is easy to use, has great scalability, and offers real-time monitoring.
// The cons include adding dependencies and requiring some time to learn it.
// Estimates for implementation of the entire Job Worker project can vary depending on our specific requirements.
// It may take as little as one week for something simple or extend to more than one month if we need extensive customization.
//    Tasks:

// 1. Evaluate and select the most suitable job processing mechanisms that align with the project's current and future requirements. - very important at least one week
// 2. Design and create the necessary database structure if applicable. - 1 to 5 days  
// 3. Implement the job worker component based on the chosen processing mechanisms. - from 1 week to more than month
// 4. Write tests and test job worker. - 1 - 5 days
// 5. Add job(likek one from the task). - depends of the requarments
// 6. Test it - 2 days
// 7. Write documentation - unknown

Console.WriteLine("Hello, Job Worker!");
